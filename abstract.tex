\paragraph{} A

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textsc{Citadel} ---  a modular, enclave-backed reference monitor to securely and verifiably implement IFC methods in the Linux kernel.
    \item Implemented using enclaves, an LSM, and an auxiliary library for unobstrusive application integration.
    \item Real-world performance overhead of $20-25\%$ observed using \textsc{Nginx} and microbenchmarks.
    \item Demonstrates potential viability of a symbiotic enclave-kernel relationship for security implementations.
\end{itemize}
