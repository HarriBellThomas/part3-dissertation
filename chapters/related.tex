\paragraph{} There is a wealth of prior theoretical and practical research that form an essential background to the work presented here. To provide adequate grounding, a handful of the most notable shall be discussed --- these are split into two distinct fields, \textit{Information Flow Control} and Intel SGX. To the best of our knowledge, little study has been conducted in this overlap, but where it exists, it will be highlighted as appropriate.


\section{\textit{Flume} and \textit{CamFlow}}
\paragraph{} Both \textit{Flume}~[X] and \textit{CamFlow}~[Y] present practical DIFC systems for generic, OS-level protection in Linux. The models they use are not too dissimilar, with \textit{CamFlow} adopting and refining the basic \textit{Flume} approach. Detailed background information applicable to both has been provided in ยง~\ref{sec:ifc}, although an overview of how they were implemented follows.

\section{Interoperation between Linux and SGX} Maybe call 'Interoperability between Linux and SGX'. TresorSGX, also talk about upstreaming the driver to the Linux kernel. Custos (new), DelegaTEE (brokered delegation), NeXUS (access control sgx)
